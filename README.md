**What this does :** 

This skill allows you to connect your exisiting Home Assistant (HA) to Alice so you can turn on or off switches
It does this through using the RESTful API.

**What this skill will control**

You will be able to control an entity in HomeAssistant that is a existing switch.*entityName* in HA

It also captures sensor.<entityName> devices too but currently only utilises some sensor readings like temperature, 
humidity etc. It does so by sending that data to Telemetry skill so you can ask Alice what's the inside 
temperature for example.

"group.*entityName*" are also captured with this skill so you can "turn off kitchen lights" or smiliar
commands that control groups of switch.<entityName> devices. 

Device states get updated every 5 minutes or when you ask " whats the state of the *device name*"
It will also tell you how long until sunset, sunrise, dusk and dawn.

*Pre Req's* -
- Alice version 1.0.0-B2 onwards 
- Make sure you're running the latest version of Home Assistant ( minimum is version 0107.5)
- Make sure you don't uninstall the Telemetry skill (it will self install if not already)
- This skill uses HA friendly names to trigger commands. So if your friendly name, for example are "gardenlights"
then i suggest you fine tune that in HA a little to read "garden lights" ( two words with no strange characters).
 That way "turn off the garden lights" is more natural than " turn off gardenlights" which only sounds natural
  when drunk :)
For now it also assumes your temperature sensors are called something like "inside temperature", "office temperature"
and not "BME280 in the Shed". Based on current code, The latter would mean you'd have to ask 
Alice " whats the BME280 temperature ", which is not very natural either :)
